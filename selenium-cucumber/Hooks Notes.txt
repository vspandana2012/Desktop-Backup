Hooks:

1)Used to define  pre-requisite adn post requisite for each scenario
2)Pre-Requisites: Like initializing the driver, launching the browser, Test data creation, Database connections, Report initialization
3)Post-Requisites; Like closing the driver, browser, closing he database connections

Two hooks available:

1)@Before
2)@After

@Before
public void setUP()
{
}

@After
public void tearDown()
{

}

@Before : will execute before for each scenario
@After   : Will execute after each scenario

Tagged Hooks: If we want to do pre-requisite and post-requisite for a particular scenario then we use tagged hooks.

Example below

@first
Scenario: Testing CRM Application
Given user is on landing page
When user enter login URL
Then user enters username and password

@Before(@first)
public void firstTest()
{
Syso("This will execute only  for first scenario ")
}

Ordered Hooks: If there are multiple pre-requisites and post requisites then we can use order to define
@Before(order=0) : This will execute first before each scenario 
@Before(order=1): This will execute second before each scenario
@After(order=0): 
@After(order=1)
