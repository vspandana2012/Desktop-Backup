Locators Concept :

This concept is used to identify the elemnet on the page.
There are seven types of locators.They are:
1.xpath - 
 *which generally gives the position of the element.
 *always use relative xpath(short)
 *absolute xpath cannot be used as it gives the hierarchy of the position of the element.In future if the position of the element changes, selenium fails to recognise it.
